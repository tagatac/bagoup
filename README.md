# bagoup [![Build Status][ci-img]][ci] [![Coverage Status][cov-img]][cov] [![Go Report Card][card-img]][card] [![Release][release-img]][release]

bagoup *(pronounced BAAGoop)* is an export utility for Mac OS Messages,
implemented in Go, inspired by
[Baskup](https://github.com/PeterKaminski09/baskup). It exports all of the
conversations saved in Messages to readable, searchable text or PDF files.

## Example Exports
### Plaintext (default)
```
$ cat "messages-export/Novak Djokovic/iMessage;-;+3815555555555.txt"
[2020-03-01 15:34:05] Me: Want to play tennis?
<attached: tennisballs.jpeg>
[2020-03-01 15:34:41] Novak: I can't today. I'm still at the Dubai Open
[2020-03-01 15:34:53] Me: Ah, okay. When are you back in SF?
[2020-03-01 15:35:23] Novak: Possibly next month. I'll let you know
[2020-03-01 15:35:50] Me: üëç
```
### PDF (--pdf flag)

## Dependencies
- [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/) (for exporting to PDF; not needed for exports to plaintext)
```
wget https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/packaging/releases/download/0.12.6-2/wkhtmltox-0.12.6-2.macos-cocoa.pkg
sudo installer -pkg wkhtmltox-0.12.6-2.macos-cocoa.pkg -target /
```

## Installation
```
brew tap tagatac/bagoup
brew install bagoup
```

## Protected File Access
The Messages database is a protected file in Mac OS. See
[this article](https://appletoolbox.com/seeing-error-operation-not-permitted-in-macos-mojave/)
for more details. Additionally, attachments can be located in various protected
places on your filesystem.

To to backup your messages, you have two options. If you wish to export to PDFs
with images (`--pdf` flag), or to copy attachments (`--copy-attachments` flag), you must use
the first option.
### Option 1 (required for attachments): Give your terminal emulator full disk access
From [osxdaily.com](https://osxdaily.com/2018/10/09/fix-operation-not-permitted-terminal-error-macos/):
1. Pull down the Apple menu and choose "System Preferences"
1. Choose "Security & Privacy" control panel
1. Now select the "Privacy" tab, then from the left-side menu select "Full Disk Access"
1. Click the lock icon in the lower left corner of the preference panel and authenticate with an admin level login
1. Now click the [+] plus button to add an application with full disk access
1. Navigate to the /Applications/Utilities/ folder and choose "Terminal" (or your terminal emulator of choice) to grant your terminal with Full Disk Access privileges
1. Relaunch your terminal emulator, and the ‚ÄúOperation not permitted‚Äù error messages will be gone

If you choose this option, bagoup will be able to open **chat.db** in its
default location, and the `--db-path` flag is not needed.
### Option 2 (more secure if attachments are not desired): Copy chat.db
Copy the Messages database to an unprotected folder in Finder, and provide the
path to the copy via the `--db-path` flag.

1. Open Finder.
1. Navigate to **~/Library/Messages**.
1. Right-click on **chat.db**, and click **Copy "chat.db"** in the context menu.
1. Navigate to your home folder or another unprotected folder.
1. Right-click in the unprotected folder, and click **Paste Item** in the
context menu.

## Contact Information (optional)
If you provide your contacts via the `--contacts-path` flag, bagoup will attempt
to match the handles from the Messages database with full names from your
contacts list, labeling the folders with full names and each message with first
names. Otherwise, phone numbers and email addresses will be used.

The contacts file must be in vCard format and can be obtained,
e.g., from the Contacts app or Google Contacts.

## Usage
```
Usage:
  bagoup [OPTIONS]

Application Options:
  -i, --db-path=          Path to the Messages chat database file (default:
                          ~/Library/Messages/chat.db)
  -o, --export-path=      Path to which the Messages will be exported (default:
                          messages-export)
  -m, --mac-os-version=   Version of Mac OS, e.g. '10.15', from which the
                          Messages chat database file was copied (not needed if
                          bagoup is running on the same Mac)
  -c, --contacts-path=    Path to the contacts vCard file
  -s, --self-handle=      Prefix to use for for messages sent by you (default:
                          Me)
      --separate-chats    Do not merge chats with the same contact (e.g.
                          iMessage and SMS) into a single file
  -p, --pdf               Export text and images to PDF files (requires full
                          disk access)
  -w, --wkhtml            Use wkhtmltopdf instead of weasyprint to generate
                          PDFs (requires wkhtmltopdf executable to be on the
                          system path - https://wkhtmltopdf.org/)
      --include-ppa       Include plugin payload attachments (e.g. link
                          previews) in generated PDFs
  -a, --copy-attachments  Copy attachments to the same folder as the chat which
                          included them (requires full disk access)
  -r, --preserve-paths    When copying attachments, preserve the full path
                          instead of co-locating them with the chats which
                          included them
  -t, --attachments-path= Root path to the attachments (useful for re-running
                          bagoup on an export created with the
                          --copy-attachments and --preserve-paths flags)
                          (default: /)
  -e, --entity=           An entity name to include in the export (matches the
                          folder name in the export, e.g. "John Smith" or
                          "+15551234567"). If given, other entities' chats will
                          not be exported. If this flag is used multiple times,
                          all entities specified will be exported.
  -v, --version           Show the version of bagoup

Help Options:
  -h, --help              Show this help message
```
All conversations will be exported as text (default) or PDF files (`--pdf` flag) to the specified export
path. See [example-exports](example-exports) for
an example export directory structure for each option.

## Performance
### Plaintext
Export to plaintext is fast. For example, on an M2 MacBook Air, exporting
**19,621 messages** from 144 chats to 138 files, as well as copying
**1,214 attachments**, took **17.2s**.
### PDF
Export to PDF is significantly slower, bottlenecked by PDF creation with
`wkhtmltopdf`. Exporting the same data from above on the same MacBook took
**9m32s**, more than 30x slower than the export to plaintext.
